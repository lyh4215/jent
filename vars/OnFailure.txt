Register failure handlers for stage failures.

Usage:
  OnFailure(String stageId, Object action)   // stage-specific
  OnFailure(Object action)                   // global

Parameters:
  stageId
    Stage id used in Stage('...').

  action
    FailureAction instance or class.
    If a class is provided, it is instantiated with a no-arg constructor.

Behavior:
  - Stage-specific handlers run for the matching stage.
  - Global handlers run for every stage failure.
  - Handlers are build-scoped via internal registry state.

Examples:
  import org.jent.failure.FailureLogAction
  import org.jent.failure.SetBuildDescriptionAction

  OnFailure('Deploy', new FailureLogAction())
  OnFailure(SetBuildDescriptionAction)
